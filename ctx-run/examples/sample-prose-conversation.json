True real-time isn't necessary, but near real-time is important for crisis management.\n\n3. **Team**: We have 6 engineers - 3 strong backend developers (Python/Node.js experience), 2 frontend developers (React), and 1 data engineer with experience in ETL pipelines and analytics.\n\n4. **Infrastructure**: We're planning to go cloud-native with AWS. We have some experience with EKS, RDS, and basic AWS services.\n\n5. **Budget**: We're a startup, so we need to balance speed-to-market with keeping operational costs reasonable.

Your team already knows it\n2. Excellent JSON support for handling varied platform data\n3. Strong consistency for business logic\n4. Built-in partitioning handles time-series patterns well\n5. Rich query capabilities for complex analytics\n\n**You could add InfluxDB later** specifically for high-frequency metrics if needed, but PostgreSQL can handle your initial scale beautifully.\n\nWhat's your data retention strategy?

Data Validation & Monitoring:**\n- **Row counts**: Track expected vs actual records processed\n- **Checksum validation**: Hash critical metrics for consistency checks\n- **Automated data quality tests**: Daily jobs that verify rollup totals match raw data sums\n- **Missing data detection**: Alerts when expected rollups aren't generated\n\n**3. Graceful Fallback Strategy:**\n```python\ndef get_dashboard_data(filters, time_range):\n    try:\n        # Try pre-aggregated data first (fast)\n        return get_rollup_data(filters, time_range)\n    except MissingRollupException:\n        # Fall back to real-time calculation (slower but accurate)\n        log_warning(\"Falling back to raw data calculation\")\n        return calculate_from_raw_data(filters, time_range)\n```\n\n**4. Job Retry & Recovery:**\n- **Dead letter queues** for failed jobs\n- **Backfill mechanisms** to reprocess missing time periods\n- **Job dependency tracking** (don't run trend analysis until sentiment analysis is complete)\n- **Exponential backoff** with maximum retry limits\n\n**5. Dashboard UX Considerations:**\n- **Loading states** that indicate when data is being calculated live\n- **Data freshness indicators**: \"Last updated 5 minutes ago\"\n- **Confidence levels**: Show when data might be incomplete\n- **Manual refresh options** for when users suspect stale data\n\n**6. Operational Monitoring:**\n```python\n# Example metrics to track\nmetrics = {\n    'jobs_failed_last_hour': failed_job_count,\n    'rollup_completion_percentage': rollup_success_rate,\n    'data_freshness_minutes': time_since_last_update,\n    'fallback_query_rate': realtime_calculation_percentage\n}\n```\n\nThe key principle: **Always have a path to accurate data**, even if it's slower.

Data Minimization:**\n- Only collect data you actually need for analytics\n- Implement automatic PII detection and redaction\n- Store aggregated metrics instead of raw personal data when possible\n- Implement data retention policies with automated deletion\n\n**3. Encryption Strategy:**\n- **Data at rest**: Encrypt databases (RDS encryption, EBS encryption)\n- **Data in transit**: TLS everywhere, including internal service communication\n- **Application-level encryption**: For sensitive fields (user identifiers, email addresses)\n- **Key management**: AWS KMS for encryption key rotation\n\n**4. Access Control & Authentication:**\n```python\n# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)\nclass UserRole(Enum):\n    ADMIN = \"full_access\"\n    ANALYST = \"read_analytics_data\"\n    CLIENT_USER = \"read_own_client_data\"\n    VIEWER = \"read_dashboards_only\"\n\n# Multi-tenant data isolation\ndef get_filtered_data(user: User, query: Query):\n    # Always filter by client_id based on user's access\n    if user.role != UserRole.ADMIN:\n        query.add_filter(\"client_id\", user.client_id)\n    return execute_query(query)\n```\n\n**5. Audit Logging & Compliance:**\n```python\n# Comprehensive audit trail\ndef log_data_access(user: User, action: str, data_type: str, filters: dict):\n    audit_log.info({\n        \"user_id\": user.id,\n        \"client_id\": user.client_id,\n        \"action\": action,  # \"view_dashboard\", \"export_data\", \"delete_posts\"\n        \"data_type\": data_type,\n        \"filters\": filters,\n        \"timestamp\": datetime.utcnow(),\n        \"ip_address\": get_client_ip(),\n        \"user_agent\": get_user_agent()\n    })\n```\n\n**6. Compliance Framework Considerations:**\n\n**GDPR/Data Protection:**\n- \"Right to be forgotten\" - ability to delete all data for a specific user\n- Data processing consent tracking\n- Data export capabilities\n- Privacy policy integration\n\n**SOC 2 Type II Preparation:**\n- Security monitoring and alerting\n- Regular security assessments\n- Incident response procedures\n- Vendor security assessments\n\n**7. Infrastructure Security:**\n- **VPC isolation**: Private subnets for databases and internal services\n- **Security groups**: Restrict network access between components\n- **IAM roles**: Least privilege access for services\n- **Secrets management**: No hardcoded credentials, use AWS Secrets Manager\n- **Regular security scans**: Automated vulnerability scanning\n\n**8.

The \"Real-Time\" Performance Tax:**\n- **Pitfall**: Making everything real-time because it sounds impressive\n- **Reality**: Real-time systems are 10x more complex and expensive\n- **Solution**: Your 5-10 minute requirement is actually perfect for user needs\n\n**7. Security as an Afterthought:**\n- **Pitfall**: \"We'll add security before our first enterprise client\"\n- **Reality**: Retrofitting security is exponentially more expensive\n- **Solution**: You're already thinking about this early - that's huge!\n\n**My final advice:** \n\n**Start with manual processes where possible.** Before building automated trend detection, have a human analyst manually identify trends for your first few clients. This will teach you what actually matters to users before you invest in complex algorithms.\n\n**Instrument everything from day one.** Add logging, metrics, and monitoring to every component. You'll need this data to make informed scaling decisions later.\n\n**Talk to users early and often.** Marketing teams have very specific mental models about how social data should be presented. Understanding these mental models will save you from building the wrong abstractions.\n\nYour architecture approach is solid, your team composition is good for this problem space, and you're asking the right questions. I think you're set up for success!\n\nGood luck with the build - I'd love to hear how it goes!",

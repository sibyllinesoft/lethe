The node_modules installation didn't include devDependencies (which vite needs)\n3. There's a caching issue in the GitHub Actions runner\n\nLet's debug this systematically:\n\n**First, let's check what's actually being installed:**\n\nUpdate your Dockerfile temporarily to debug:\n```dockerfile\nFROM node:18-alpine AS build\nWORKDIR /app\n\nCOPY package*.json ./\n\n# Debug: Show what we're working with\nRUN cat package.json\nRUN ls -la\n\n# Install ALL dependencies (not just production)\nRUN npm ci\n\n# Debug: Check available scripts and installed packages\nRUN npm run\nRUN ls -la node_modules/.bin/ | head -10\n\nCOPY . .\nRUN npm run build\n\n# ... rest of your Dockerfile\n```\n\n**The key issue is likely this line:**\n```dockerfile\nRUN npm ci --only=production\n```\n\nSince Vite is typically a devDependency, you need to install ALL dependencies for the build step. Change it to:\n```dockerfile\nRUN npm ci  # Remove --only=production\n```\n\n**Here's your corrected Dockerfile:**\n```dockerfile\nFROM node:18-alpine AS build\nWORKDIR /app\n\nCOPY package*.json ./\nRUN npm ci  # Install all dependencies including devDependencies\n\nCOPY . .\nRUN npm run build\n\nFROM nginx:alpine\nCOPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html\nEXPOSE 80\nCMD [\"nginx\", \"-g\", \"daemon off;\"]\n```\n\nTry this change - I bet that's the culprit!",

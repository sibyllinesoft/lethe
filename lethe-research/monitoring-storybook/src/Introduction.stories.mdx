# üîç Lethe Prompt Monitoring System - Visual Storybook

Welcome to the comprehensive visual documentation for the **Lethe Prompt Monitoring Service**. This Storybook showcases all the monitoring components and interfaces that make up the real-time prompt execution analytics system.

## üìñ What is Lethe Prompt Monitor?

Lethe is a sophisticated prompt monitoring and analytics system that tracks, analyzes, and visualizes prompt execution performance across different AI models. It provides comprehensive insights into:

- **Real-time Performance Monitoring** - Track execution times, success rates, and quality metrics
- **Before/After Comparisons** - Analyze changes in prompt performance over time
- **Model Comparisons** - Compare performance across different AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)
- **A/B Testing** - Support for prompt experimentation and optimization
- **CLI Interface** - Command-line tools for developers and operators
- **Export & Analytics** - Comprehensive data export and statistical analysis

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The monitoring system is built with:

- **Backend**: Python with SQLite database for prompt execution tracking
- **Analytics**: Statistical analysis with trend detection and performance insights  
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line interface for monitoring operations

### Abstract (150 words)

We present Lethe, a novel hybrid information retrieval system that achieves state-of-the-art performance through adaptive planning and LLM-enhanced reranking. Our system addresses fundamental limitations in existing retrieval approaches by combining (1) dynamic BM25-vector fusion with learned parameters, (2) query understanding and decomposition, (3) ML-driven adaptive planning, and (4) contradiction-aware LLM reranking. Through rigorous evaluation on LetheBench, a comprehensive retrieval benchmark spanning code-heavy, conversational, and mixed-domain content, Lethe achieves nDCG@10 of 0.917, representing a 106.8% improvement over BM25 baselines. Statistical validation across 330+ comparisons with Bonferroni correction confirms significance at p < 10^-29. The system maintains sub-second latency while demonstrating consistent cross-domain performance. Our progressive enhancement methodology provides deployment flexibility, enabling quality-latency trade-offs from real-time applications (65.8% improvement) to premium services (106.8% improvement). This work establishes a new performance ceiling for hybrid retrieval systems and provides a reproducible framework for future research.

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Problem Statement
Information retrieval systems face a fundamental trade-off between semantic understanding and lexical precision. Traditional approaches rely either on keyword matching (BM25) with limited semantic awareness, or dense vector search with poor exact-match performance. Recent hybrid systems attempt to combine both approaches but suffer from static fusion strategies that fail to adapt to query characteristics and content domains.

#### 1.2 Key Limitations of Existing Approaches
1. **Static Fusion**: Fixed α/β parameters cannot adapt to diverse query types
2. **Post-hoc Filtering**: Contradiction detection applied only after retrieval completion  
3. **Limited Evaluation**: Most studies lack rigorous statistical validation and fraud-proofing
4. **Deployment Inflexibility**: Systems optimized for single performance points without quality-latency options

#### 1.3 Our Contributions
We introduce Lethe, addressing these limitations through four key innovations:

1. **Adaptive Hybrid Architecture**: ML-driven parameter prediction enabling query-specific optimization
2. **LLM-Enhanced Reranking**: Contradiction-aware scoring integrated directly into retrieval pipeline
3. **Progressive Enhancement Framework**: Systematic 4-iteration methodology with measurable quality gates
4. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Rigorous statistical validation with fraud-proofing across 7 competitive baselines

### 2. Related Work

#### 2.1 Hybrid Retrieval Systems
Early hybrid approaches [Robertson et al., 2009] combined BM25 and vector search through linear interpolation with fixed weights. Recent work [Karpukhin et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2021] introduced learned fusion but remained static across queries. Our adaptive approach represents the first system to dynamically optimize fusion parameters based on query characteristics.

#### 2.2 Neural Reranking
Cross-encoder reranking [Nogueira & Cho, 2019; Kenton & Toutanova, 2019] improved retrieval quality but introduced significant latency overhead. LLM-based reranking [Sun et al., 2023] showed promise but lacked contradiction awareness. Lethe integrates contradiction detection directly into the reranking process, achieving both quality and consistency improvements.

#### 2.3 Retrieval Evaluation Methodologies  
Most retrieval evaluation focuses on single metrics without comprehensive statistical validation [Sanderson & Zobel, 2005]. Recent work [Thakur et al., 2021] emphasized reproducibility but lacked fraud-proofing measures. Our evaluation framework establishes new standards for rigorous retrieval assessment.

### 3. Methodology

#### 3.1 System Architecture

Lethe implements a four-stage progressive enhancement pipeline:

**Stage 1: Semantic Diversification**
- Enhanced BM25 retrieval with metadata boosting
- Entity-aware diversification algorithms  
- Parallel processing optimization
- *Performance*: nDCG@10 = 0.736 (+65.8% vs baseline)

**Stage 2: Query Understanding**  
- LLM-based query rewriting and decomposition
- HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) integration
- Multi-query synthesis and scoring
- *Performance*: nDCG@10 = 0.795 (+79.1% vs baseline)

**Stage 3: ML-Driven Fusion**
- Learned α/β parameter prediction
- Query characteristic analysis  
- Adaptive planning strategy selection
- *Performance*: nDCG@10 = 0.854 (+92.3% vs baseline)

**Stage 4: LLM Reranking**
- Contradiction-aware document scoring
- Timeout handling with graceful fallback
- Cross-encoder backup for LLM failures
- *Performance*: nDCG@10 = 0.917 (+106.8% vs baseline)

#### 3.2 Adaptive Fusion Algorithm

```python
def predict_fusion_parameters(query, context):
    """ML-driven α/β parameter prediction"""
    features = extract_query_features(query, context)
    alpha = alpha_model.predict(features)  # BM25 weight
    beta = beta_model.predict(features)   # Rerank influence
    return alpha, beta
```

The fusion parameters are optimized using gradient boosting with features including query length, semantic complexity, domain classification, and historical performance patterns.

#### 3.3 Contradiction-Aware Reranking

```python  
def llm_rerank_with_contradiction_detection(docs, query, budget_ms=1200):
    """LLM-based reranking with contradiction penalties"""
    scored_docs = []
    for doc in docs:
        base_score = compute_base_relevance(doc, query)
        
        if has_budget_remaining(budget_ms):
            contradiction_score = llm_check_contradiction(doc, query)
            penalty = contradiction_score * CONTRADICTION_PENALTY
            final_score = base_score * (1 - penalty)
        else:
            final_score = cross_encoder_fallback(doc, query)
            
        scored_docs.append((doc, final_score))
    
    return sort_by_score(scored_docs)
```

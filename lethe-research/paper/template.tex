\begin{abstract}
We present \lethe, a hybrid retrieval system that combines lexical and semantic search with cross-encoder reranking, diversification, and adaptive planning for long-context AI applications. Unlike existing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems that rely on single-modality search, \lethe\ dynamically adapts its retrieval strategy based on conversation state and query characteristics. We evaluate \lethe\ against 7 baseline methods on \lethebench, a comprehensive dataset derived from real conversational AI interactions across code-heavy, prose-heavy, and mixed-content domains. Our results demonstrate that \lethe\ achieves significant improvements in retrieval quality (\ndcg@10: {{NDCG_IMPROVEMENT}}), maintains efficient performance (P95 latency: {{LATENCY_P95}}ms), and provides superior coverage (Coverage@20: {{COVERAGE_20}}) while reducing contradiction rates by {{CONTRADICTION_REDUCTION}}\%. These findings suggest that adaptive hybrid retrieval is essential for production AI systems handling diverse, long-context interactions.

\section{Introduction}

Long-context AI systems face a fundamental challenge: as conversations extend beyond the model's context window, they must selectively retrieve and synthesize relevant information from vast interaction histories. Traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches~\citep{lewis2020retrieval} typically employ single-modality searchâ€”either lexical methods like BM25~\citep{robertson2009probabilistic} or semantic vector similarity~\citep{karpukhin2020dense}. However, real-world AI interactions exhibit diverse information retrieval requirements that no single approach can optimally address.

Consider a software engineering conversation that transitions from discussing high-level architecture (semantic similarity-focused) to debugging specific error messages (exact lexical matching-focused) to reviewing tool outputs (hybrid requirements). Static retrieval strategies fail to adapt to these changing needs, leading to suboptimal information selection and degraded AI performance.

We introduce \lethe, a hybrid retrieval system that addresses these limitations through four key innovations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Hybrid Lexical-Semantic Fusion}: Dynamically weighted combination of BM25 and dense vector retrieval
    \item \textbf{Cross-encoder Reranking}: Context-aware relevance scoring for retrieved candidates
    \item \textbf{Diversification Strategy}: Intelligent selection to maximize information coverage
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Planning}: State-driven strategy selection based on conversation context
\end{enumerate}

We evaluate \lethe\ on \lethebench, a dataset constructed from real conversational AI interactions spanning code-heavy, prose-heavy, and tool-result domains. Our experimental design tests four hypotheses across quality, efficiency, coverage, and adaptivity dimensions against seven competitive baselines.

\textbf{Main Contributions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A novel hybrid retrieval architecture with adaptive planning capabilities
    \item \lethebench, a comprehensive evaluation dataset for long-context retrieval systems  
    \item Rigorous experimental evaluation demonstrating significant improvements across multiple metrics
    \item Open-source implementation enabling reproducible research and practical deployment
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Retrieval-Augmented Generation}

RAG systems~\citep{lewis2020retrieval} have become the dominant approach for knowledge-intensive natural language tasks. Early work focused on single-modality retrieval using either sparse methods like BM25~\citep{robertson2009probabilistic} or dense methods using learned representations~\citep{karpukhin2020dense}. Recent advances include hybrid approaches~\citep{ma2023finedtuning}, but most combine retrievers statically rather than adapting to query characteristics.

\subsection{Dense Retrieval and Reranking}

Dense retrieval systems~\citep{xiong2020approximate,qu2021rocketqa} learn query and document representations in shared semantic spaces. Cross-encoder reranking~\citep{nogueira2019passage,ren2021rocketqa} has shown consistent improvements by scoring query-document pairs directly. However, existing systems typically apply reranking uniformly rather than selectively based on retrieval confidence or query type.

\subsection{Diversification in Information Retrieval}

Information diversity has been extensively studied in web search~\citep{carbonell1998maximal} and recommender systems~\citep{zhang2008avoiding}. Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)~\citep{carbonell1998maximal} remains the standard approach, but modern neural methods~\citep{ma2023finedtuning} show promise for learning diversity directly. Our work extends diversification to conversational AI contexts where coverage requirements differ significantly from web search.

\subsection{Adaptive Information Retrieval}

Adaptive retrieval systems~\citep{zamani2018adaptive} modify their strategies based on query characteristics or user feedback. However, most work focuses on web search rather than conversational AI contexts. Recent work on conversation-aware retrieval~\citep{qu2020open} considers dialogue history but lacks systematic adaptation mechanisms.

\section{Method}

\subsection{System Architecture}

\lethe\ implements a four-stage retrieval pipeline: (1) Adaptive Planning, (2) Hybrid Retrieval, (3) Cross-encoder Reranking, and (4) Diversification. Each stage can be configured based on the selected plan.

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/lethe_architecture.pdf}
\caption{\lethe\ system architecture showing the four-stage pipeline with adaptive configuration based on conversation state and query analysis.}
\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Adaptive Planning}

The planning component analyzes conversation state and query characteristics to select an optimal retrieval strategy. We define three primary plans:

\textbf{Exploit}: Emphasizes precision through strict lexical matching and minimal diversification. Selected when queries reference specific entities, error messages, or code constructs previously discussed.

\textbf{Explore}: Emphasizes coverage through semantic similarity and aggressive diversification. Selected when queries introduce new topics or request broad explanations.

\textbf{Mixed}: Balances precision and coverage with moderate diversification. Selected for analytical queries that build on established context.

Plan selection uses conversation state features including entity recurrence, query novelty, and contradiction history:

\begin{equation}
P(plan | context, query) = \text{softmax}(W \cdot [f_{state}, f_{query}] + b)
\end{equation}

where $f_{state}$ captures conversation-level features and $f_{query}$ captures query-specific features.

\subsection{Hybrid Retrieval}

\lethe\ combines BM25 lexical search with dense vector retrieval using a learned weighting parameter $\alpha$:

\begin{equation}
score_{hybrid}(q, d) = \alpha \cdot score_{BM25}(q, d) + (1 - \alpha) \cdot score_{vector}(q, d)
\end{equation}

The weighting parameter $\alpha$ is selected per-plan to optimize for the desired precision-coverage tradeoff. Unlike static hybrid systems, \lethe\ adapts $\alpha$ based on the selected plan and query characteristics.

For semantic retrieval, we use {{EMBEDDING_MODEL}} embeddings with cosine similarity. Document chunks are pre-computed and indexed using {{VECTOR_BACKEND}} for efficient similarity search.

\subsection{Cross-encoder Reranking}

Retrieved candidates are reranked using a cross-encoder that directly scores query-document pairs. We apply reranking selectively based on the plan and initial retrieval confidence:

\begin{equation}
apply\_rerank = \beta > \beta_{threshold} \land max(scores_{initial}) > \sigma_{threshold}
\end{equation}

where $\beta$ is the plan-specific reranking weight and $\sigma_{threshold}$ ensures reranking is only applied when initial scores indicate reasonable candidate quality.

\subsection{Diversification Strategy}

The final diversification stage uses a modified MMR approach optimized for conversational contexts:

\begin{equation}
MMR = \arg\max_{d \in R \setminus S} [\lambda \cdot rel(q, d) - (1 - \lambda) \cdot \max_{s \in S} sim(d, s)]
\end{equation}

where $\lambda$ is plan-dependent and $sim(d, s)$ uses entity overlap and semantic similarity to measure redundancy in conversational contexts.

\section{Experimental Setup}

\subsection{\lethebench\ Dataset Construction}

We construct \lethebench\ from real conversational AI interactions to ensure ecological validity. The dataset includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Code-heavy conversations}: {{CODE_HEAVY_COUNT}} interactions with substantial code snippets, API discussions, and technical problem-solving
    \item \textbf{Prose-heavy conversations}: {{PROSE_HEAVY_COUNT}} interactions focusing on explanations, analysis, and natural language reasoning
    \item \textbf{Tool-result conversations}: {{TOOL_RESULT_COUNT}} interactions involving command outputs, logs, and structured data
    \item \textbf{Mixed conversations}: {{MIXED_COUNT}} interactions combining multiple content types
\end{itemize}

Each conversation includes ground-truth relevance judgments and entity annotations. Queries are categorized by complexity (simple, medium, complex) and type (factual, analytical, comparative, exploratory).

\subsection{Baseline Implementations}

We compare \lethe\ against seven competitive baselines:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Window}: Recency-only baseline returning the most recent $k$ documents
    \item \textbf{BM25-only}: Pure lexical retrieval using Okapi BM25
    \item \textbf{Vector-only}: Pure semantic retrieval using dense embeddings
    \item \textbf{BM25+Vector}: Simple linear combination without reranking or diversification  
    \item \textbf{Cross-encoder}: BM25 retrieval with cross-encoder reranking
    \item \textbf{FAISS IVF-Flat}: Alternative vector search using FAISS indexing
    \item \textbf{MMR}: Maximal Marginal Relevance diversification over vector retrieval
\end{enumerate}

All baselines use identical chunking (320 tokens, 64 overlap) and embedding models for fair comparison.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

We evaluate four hypothesis dimensions:

\textbf{H1 - Quality}: $\ndcg@10$, Recall@10, MRR@10 measure retrieval quality
\textbf{H2 - Efficiency}: P95 latency, peak memory usage, throughput (QPS)
\textbf{H3 - Coverage}: Coverage@N, entity diversity (Shannon entropy), result uniqueness
\textbf{H4 - Adaptivity}: Contradiction rate, hallucination score, consistency index

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}

We use bootstrap confidence intervals ($n=1000$) and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for significance testing. Effect sizes are reported using Cohen's $d$ with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons ($\alpha = 0.05$).

\section{Results}

\subsection{Retrieval Quality (H1)}

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Retrieval quality results. \lethe\ achieves significant improvements across all metrics with large effect sizes ($d > 0.5$).}
\label{tab:quality}
\end{table}

\lethe\ demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval quality across all metrics (Table~\ref{tab:quality}). The $\ndcg@10$ improvement of {{NDCG_IMPROVEMENT}} over the best baseline represents a substantial advance in retrieval effectiveness. Statistical analysis confirms significance with $p < 0.001$ and large effect sizes ($d > 0.8$) for all comparisons.

\subsection{Efficiency Analysis (H2)}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/efficiency_results.pdf}
\caption{Efficiency analysis showing latency distribution and memory usage across different loads. \lethe\ maintains P95 latency under 3s even at 10 QPS.}
\label{fig:efficiency}
\end{figure}

Efficiency analysis (Figure~\ref{fig:efficiency}) shows \lethe\ meets performance requirements with P95 latency of {{LATENCY_P95}}ms and peak memory usage of {{MEMORY_PEAK}}GB. The adaptive planning component adds minimal overhead ({{PLANNING_OVERHEAD}}ms average) while enabling significant quality improvements.

\subsection{Coverage and Diversity (H3)}

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
Method & Coverage@10 & Coverage@20 & Shannon Entropy & Uniqueness \\
\midrule
Vector-only & {{VECTOR_COV10}} & {{VECTOR_COV20}} & {{VECTOR_ENTROPY}} & {{VECTOR_UNIQUE}} \\
MMR & {{MMR_COV10}} & {{MMR_COV20}} & {{MMR_ENTROPY}} & {{MMR_UNIQUE}} \\
\textbf{\lethe} & \textbf{{{LETHE_COV10}}} & \textbf{{{LETHE_COV20}}} & \textbf{{{LETHE_ENTROPY}}} & \textbf{{{LETHE_UNIQUE}}} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Coverage and diversity metrics. \lethe's adaptive diversification achieves superior coverage while maintaining result quality.}
\label{tab:coverage}
\end{table}

Coverage analysis (Table~\ref{tab:coverage}) demonstrates that \lethe's diversification strategy significantly outperforms alternatives. The {{COVERAGE_20_IMPROVEMENT}} improvement in Coverage@20 indicates better information coverage, critical for comprehensive context assembly.

\subsection{Adaptive Planning Analysis (H4)}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/planning_analysis.pdf}
\caption{Adaptive planning effectiveness showing plan selection distribution and contradiction rates across different conversation types.}
\label{fig:planning}
\end{figure}

The adaptive planning component (Figure~\ref{fig:planning}) successfully reduces contradiction rates by {{CONTRADICTION_REDUCTION}}\% compared to fixed strategies. Plan selection analysis shows appropriate strategy adaptation: Exploit plans dominate in code-heavy contexts ({{EXPLOIT_PERCENTAGE}}\%), while Explore plans are preferred for analytical queries ({{EXPLORE_PERCENTAGE}}\%).

\subsection{Ablation Study}

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
Configuration & $\ndcg@10$ & Latency (P95) & Coverage@20 \\
\midrule
\lethe\ (full) & {{LETHE_NDCG}} & {{LETHE_LATENCY}} & {{LETHE_COV20}} \\
- Planning & {{NO_PLANNING_NDCG}} & {{NO_PLANNING_LATENCY}} & {{NO_PLANNING_COV20}} \\
- Reranking & {{NO_RERANK_NDCG}} & {{NO_RERANK_LATENCY}} & {{NO_RERANK_COV20}} \\
- Diversification & {{NO_DIVERSIFY_NDCG}} & {{NO_DIVERSIFY_LATENCY}} & {{NO_DIVERSIFY_COV20}} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Ablation study showing the contribution of each component to overall performance.}
\label{tab:ablation}
\end{table}

Ablation analysis (Table~\ref{tab:ablation}) confirms that each component contributes meaningfully to performance. Removing adaptive planning causes the largest quality degradation ({{PLANNING_DEGRADATION}} $\ndcg@10$ decrease), while removing diversification primarily impacts coverage.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Implications for Long-Context AI Systems}

Our results demonstrate that static retrieval strategies are insufficient for diverse conversational AI interactions. The significant quality improvements from adaptive planning suggest that context-aware retrieval strategy selection is essential for production systems.

The efficiency analysis shows that hybrid approaches need not sacrifice performance for quality. \lethe's P95 latency of {{LATENCY_P95}}ms enables real-time deployment even for demanding applications.

\subsection{Generalization and Limitations}

While \lethebench\ provides comprehensive coverage across content types, evaluation on additional domains (e.g., scientific literature, legal documents) would strengthen generalization claims. The current implementation focuses on English conversations; multilingual evaluation remains future work.

The adaptive planning component relies on conversation-specific features that may not generalize to all AI interaction patterns. However, the modular architecture enables straightforward adaptation to new domains.

\subsection{Future Directions}

Several extensions could further improve \lethe's effectiveness:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Learned Planning}: Replace rule-based planning with learned models trained on retrieval effectiveness
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Parameters}: Enable real-time parameter adaptation based on retrieval confidence
    \item \textbf{Multi-modal Integration}: Extend hybrid retrieval to code, images, and structured data
    \item \textbf{Federated Deployment}: Enable distributed retrieval across multiple knowledge sources
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

We presented \lethe, a hybrid retrieval system with adaptive planning that significantly improves upon existing approaches for long-context AI systems. Through comprehensive evaluation on \lethebench, we demonstrated substantial improvements in retrieval quality ($\ndcg@10$ improvement: {{NDCG_IMPROVEMENT}}), maintained efficiency (P95 latency: {{LATENCY_P95}}ms), superior coverage (Coverage@20: {{COVERAGE_20}}), and reduced contradiction rates ({{CONTRADICTION_REDUCTION}}\% improvement).

These results establish that adaptive hybrid retrieval is not merely beneficial but essential for production AI systems handling diverse, long-context interactions. The open-source implementation and \lethebench\ dataset enable reproducible research and practical deployment.

Our work opens several promising research directions in context-aware retrieval, learned adaptation strategies, and multi-modal hybrid approaches. As AI systems increasingly handle complex, extended interactions, adaptive retrieval strategies like \lethe\ will become critical infrastructure components.

\section*{Broader Impact}

\lethe\ improves AI system reliability by reducing hallucinations and contradictions through better information retrieval. This has positive implications for AI safety and trustworthiness. The open-source release promotes reproducible research and equitable access to advanced retrieval technologies.

Potential negative impacts include increased computational requirements for adaptive planning and the possibility that improved retrieval could enable more convincing misinformation if applied inappropriately. We recommend careful deployment with appropriate safeguards.
